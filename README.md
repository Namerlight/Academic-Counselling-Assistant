# Academic Counselling Assistant - ACA

For NSU CSE327 (Software Engineering). A fully fledged web application, with the backend written in PHP using Laravel Framework and pure Python. The android app's backend is also written in PHP, and the front end with Java using Gradle.

Probably the most expansive project done so far. The SRS and SDS contain more details, but the basic list of features include:
- Website with User Registration and Account Management.
- List of top 100 Universities with some details.
- A selection of programs from those universities.
- Searching and filtering for the above two info sets.
- A MySQL database to hold all the information involved.
- Android App, with only the UI functional, no DB connection
- AI using Linear Regression to calculate university suggestions.

Far too many different aspects involved for my liking, honestly, and integration was extremely messy too. Might as well just use Firebase next time.
